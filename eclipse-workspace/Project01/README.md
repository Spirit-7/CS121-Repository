# Project 1: Playlist Analyzer

* Author: Joey Weston
* Class: CS121 Section 004
* Semester: Spring 2022

## Overview

This program gathers information about 3 songs provided by the user
when prompted from the commandline. After storing this data as
objects, the program calculates statistics for song play times
and prints that information to the user. The program will also
print an playlist ordered from smallest to largest playtime.

## Reflection

Overall I really enjoyed this project. I understood it and liked
working with it more than the prevois project. I got done with this
project sooner as well, having multiple days to spare before it is due.

The hardest thing I ran into was to stop myself from using loops in
the programs code. After learning about while and for loops, it was
easier to see when they could be useful while writing this project.
Overall I enjoyed the project and can't wait to work on more in the
future!

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute this command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac Playlist.java
```
Then run the complied class with:
```
$ java Playlist
```
The program will then ask for information regarding 3 songs.

Follow the prompts given through the command line and enter the information.

After entering all the information no further action from the user is required.
